# SDP-Group-20

Rather than clone the git repo (because the SDPRobots wifi doesn't let you do that). Instead I've written an ssh script that will copy the local files to the bash script (the entire git repo) and clone that onto the pi (to simulate a git repo). To put the updated files onto the pi and github at the same time, all you need to do is run: <br>
```./ssh_run.expect``` <br>
from the local directory inside the git repo <br>
